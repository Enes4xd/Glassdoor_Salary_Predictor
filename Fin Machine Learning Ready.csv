Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.

96,Business Analyst,£39K-£41K (Glassdoor Est.),"Started in 2000, Efficio is a specialist management consultancy, focused on procurement and supply chain improvement programmes. There are currently c.450 employees globally, with exciting plans to grow rapidly in the next 18 months. We are a truly international organisation with over 30 different languages spoken. The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses.
Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) in various locations to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments. Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting. Although based out of our office in Piccadilly Circus, London, our BAs might, from time to time, be required to be on client site up to 4 days a week, depending on project needs. Because of this, flexibility to travel is essential.

Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise large data sets from a variety of sources, mastering the use of Excel and SQL. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work alongside the digital team to support the day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers via eFlow, as well as utilising Tableau to visualise the results of various analyses and support the project team in presenting the data in the most effective way. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.

BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. BAs must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.

Operations - Divisional Overview

The Operations division is an integral part of the independent control
and support structure whose key mandate is to establish and maintain an
effective control environment. Robust control and risk management drives our
business.

Operations strategy is underpinned by 3 guiding principles:

=
Payments: Pay our policyholders, Trustees and counterparties accurately
and on time, within regulatory guidelines

=
Policyholders: Follow the Regulator’s Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)
guidance and ensure a best-in-class policyholder experience

=
Data: Maintain accurate and complete data for risk and capital
management

These 3 principles drive our processes and controls, and are essential
for protecting our reputation, managing our risk and capital position, and
managing our Third Party Administrators (TPAs).

General activities of the Operations team include:

• Act
as an independent control over transactions of the Business

• Trade
capture and risk mitigation to ensure bookings are an accurate reflection of
business risk

• Execution
and management of lifecycle events

• Support
of project teams in department-wide initiatives

• Development
of technology infrastructure to support the risk management and processing
capabilities of transactions

• Close
data analysis and reconciliations involving breaking down and data manipulation

The Operations BAU Team is responsible for ensuring all operational
requirements across our Liability and Reinsurance contracts are serviced
correctly. This role will suit a person who is enthusiastic, ambitious and
hard-working, who has a desire to work in a fast-paced and demanding
environment, who can work independently as well as being part of a small team,
and who is able to communicate effectively and demonstrate initiative. It is
key that the candidate understands the role that Operations plays in a
financial services firm. The candidate must possess an analytical mind-set
where they are able to formulate processes that achieve the required

important that they are self-driven to deliver against targets whilst managing
time and expectations independently. The role would ideally suit a
graduate or an analyst with 1-2 years’ work experience.

Responsibilities:

=
Complete a range of daily control activities which include ensuring
front to back data flows are accurate, trade capture is correct and
payments/funding occur accurately and on time

=
Execution and management of lifecycle events such as routine data
cleanses

=
Monitor accuracy of liability and reinsurance data being maintained by
TPAs which ultimately drives the P/L for the business. This is done through
data reconciliations and the use of exception reporting

=
Work with our TPAs to ensure operational service is delivered accurately
and per SLA. This will involve resolving queries and working with our
TPAs to refine and build process improvements

=
Reporting of key risk metrics to management

=
Perform a number of data reconciliations, analysing results and seeing
issues through to completion

=
Continuous process improvement is key in this growth business and
supporting projects and technology change is a function of this role

Skills & Experience:

Required:

=
Minimum 2:1 degree from a leading university (please note strong
candidates with exceptional work experience will also be considered should the
degree criteria not be met)

=
Demonstrable ability to manage multiple projects, tasks and own
workload, whilst remaining focused on operational risks

=
Ability to demonstrate collaborative working practises, soliciting
feedback from others on work and ideas

=
Ability to think about the big picture and deliver above and beyond core
functions

=
Accuracy and absolute attention to detail

=
Strong communication skills to clearly articulate status and issues to
others

Preferred:

=
Strong MS Excel / VBA skills

=
Some pensions, insurance and/or reinsurance knowledge

=
Ability to work with complex documentation and identify operational
controls

=
Experience supervising or managing individuals

=
Understanding of risk controls in an operational environment, including
knowledge of RCSAs

Operations - Divisional Overview

The Operations division is an integral part of the independent control
and support structure whose key mandate is to establish and maintain an
effective control environment. Robust control and risk management drives our
business.

Operations strategy is underpinned by 3 guiding principles:

=
Payments: Pay our policyholders, Trustees and counterparties accurately
and on time, within regulatory guidelines

=
Policyholders: Follow the Regulator’s Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)
guidance and ensure a best-in-class policyholder experience

=
Data: Maintain accurate and complete data for risk and capital
management

These 3 principles drive our processes and controls, and are essential
for protecting our reputation, managing our risk and capital position, and
managing our Third Party Administrators (TPAs).

General activities of the Operations team include:

• Act
as an independent control over transactions of the Business

• Trade
capture and risk mitigation to ensure bookings are an accurate reflection of
business risk

• Execution
and management of lifecycle events

• Support
of project teams in department-wide initiatives

• Development
of technology infrastructure to support the risk management and processing
capabilities of transactions

• Close
data analysis and reconciliations involving breaking down and data manipulation

The Operations BAU Team is responsible for ensuring all operational
requirements across our Liability and Reinsurance contracts are serviced
correctly. This role will suit a person who is enthusiastic, ambitious and
hard-working, who has a desire to work in a fast-paced and demanding
environment, who can work independently as well as being part of a small team,

key that the candidate understands the role that Operations plays in a
financial services firm. The candidate must possess an analytical mind-set
where they are able to formulate processes that achieve the required
controls.

important that they are self-driven to deliver against targets whilst managing
time and expectations independently. The role would ideally suit a
graduate or an analyst with 1-2 years’ work experience.

Responsibilities:

=
Complete a range of daily control activities which include ensuring
front to back data flows are accurate, trade capture is correct and
payments/funding occur accurately and on time

=
Execution and management of lifecycle events such as routine data
cleanses

=
Monitor accuracy of liability and reinsurance data being maintained by
TPAs which ultimately drives the P/L for the business. This is done through
data reconciliations and the use of exception reporting

=
Work with our TPAs to ensure operational service is delivered accurately
and per SLA. This will involve resolving queries and working with our
TPAs to refine and build process improvements

=
Reporting of key risk metrics to management

=
Perform a number of data reconciliations, analysing results and seeing
issues through to completion

=
Continuous process improvement is key in this growth business and
supporting projects and technology change is a function of this role

Skills & Experience:

Required:

=
Minimum 2:1 degree from a leading university (please note strong
candidates with exceptional work experience will also be considered should the
degree criteria not be met)

=
Demonstrable ability to manage multiple projects, tasks and own
workload, whilst remaining focused on operational risks

=
Ability to demonstrate collaborative working practises, soliciting
feedback from others on work and ideas

=
Ability to think about the big picture and deliver above and beyond core
functions

Operations - Divisional Overview

The Operations division is an integral part of the independent control
and support structure whose key mandate is to establish and maintain an
effective control environment. Robust control and risk management drives our
business.

Operations strategy is underpinned by 3 guiding principles:

=
Payments: Pay our policyholders, Trustees and counterparties accurately
and on time, within regulatory guidelines

=
Policyholders: Follow the Regulator’s Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)
guidance and ensure a best-in-class policyholder experience

=
Data: Maintain accurate and complete data for risk and capital
management

These 3 principles drive our processes and controls, and are essential
for protecting our reputation, managing our risk and capital position, and
managing our Third Party Administrators (TPAs).

General activities of the Operations team include:

• Act
as an independent control over transactions of the Business

• Trade
capture and risk mitigation to ensure bookings are an accurate reflection of
business risk

• Execution
and management of lifecycle events

• Support
of project teams in department-wide initiatives

• Development
of technology infrastructure to support the risk management and processing
capabilities of transactions

environment, who can work independently as well as being part of a small team,
and who is able to communicate effectively and demonstrate initiative. It is
key that the candidate understands the role that Operations plays in a
financial services firm. The candidate must possess an analytical mind-set
where they are able to formulate processes that achieve the required
controls.

The position available gives the candidate a lot of autonomy and it is
important that they are self-driven to deliver against targets whilst managing
time and expectations independently. The role would ideally suit a
graduate or an analyst with 1-2 years’ work experience.

Responsibilities:

=
Complete a range of daily control activities which include ensuring
front to back data flows are accurate, trade capture is correct and
payments/funding occur accurately and on time

=
Execution and management of lifecycle events such as routine data
cleanses

=
Monitor accuracy of liability and reinsurance data being maintained by
TPAs which ultimately drives the P/L for the business. This is done through
data reconciliations and the use of exception reporting

=
Work with our TPAs to ensure operational service is delivered accurately
and per SLA. This will involve resolving queries and working with our
TPAs to refine and build process improvements

=
Reporting of key risk metrics to management

=
Perform a number of data reconciliations, analysing results and seeing
issues through to completion

=
Continuous process improvement is key in this growth business and
supporting projects and technology change is a function of this role

Skills & Experience:

Required:

=
Minimum 2:1 degree from a leading university (please note strong
candidates with exceptional work experience will also be considered should the
degree criteria not be met)

=
Demonstrable ability to manage multiple projects, tasks and own

We hire a diverse range of junior professionals and graduates from across the country, we pay you while we train you in the latest data and business skills and then place you into industry-leading companies in a variety of different sectors. Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.
Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:
Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.
You will also have access to the following soft skills workshops:
Presentation & interview skills and practice
Lunch and Learns – How to research your client before an interview?
Q&As with HQ Teams, Consultant on placements, Kubrick Alumni and Clients
Client Surgeries & Networking
Transition to Client Site
Career Management & Personal Value Statement
What we need from you:
A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand
An ambition to work with data - don’t let it intimidate you, learning some coding is crucial in today’s age

We hire a diverse range of junior professionals and graduates from across the country, we pay you while we train you in the latest data and business skills and then place you into industry-leading companies in a variety of different sectors. Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.
Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:
Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.
You will also have access to the following soft skills workshops:
Presentation & interview skills and practice
Lunch and Learns – How to research your client before an interview?

Client Surgeries & Networking
Transition to Client Site

What we need from you:
A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand

There are currently c.450 employees globally, with exciting plans to grow rapidly in the next 18 months. We are a truly international organisation with over 30 different languages spoken. The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses.
Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) in various locations to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments. Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting. Although based out of our office in Piccadilly Circus, London, our BAs might, from time to time, be required to be on client site up to 4 days a week, depending on project needs. Because of this, flexibility to travel is essential.

Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise large data sets from a variety of sources, mastering the use of Excel and SQL. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work alongside the digital team to support the day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers via eFlow, as well as utilising Tableau to visualise the results of various analyses and support the project team in presenting the data in the most effective way. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.

BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. BAs must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.

(Glassdoor Est.)","Started in 2000, Efficio is a specialist management consultancy, focused on procurement and supply chain improvement programmes. There are currently c.450 employees globally, with exciting plans to grow rapidly in the next 18 months. We are a truly international organisation with over 30 different languages spoken. The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses.
Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) in various locations to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments. Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting. Although based out of our office in Piccadilly Circus, London, our BAs might, from time to time, be required to be on client site up to 4 days a week, depending on project needs. Because of this, flexibility to travel is essential.

Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise large data sets from a variety of sources, mastering the use of Excel and SQL. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work alongside the digital team to support the day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers via eFlow, as well as utilising Tableau to visualise the results of various analyses and support the project team in presenting the data in the most effective way. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.

BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. BAs must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.

Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.
Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:
Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.

Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.
Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:
Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.
You will also have access to the following soft skills workshops:
Presentation & interview skills and practice
Lunch and Learns – How to research your client before an interview?
Q&As with HQ Teams, Consultant on placements, Kubrick Alumni and Clients
Client Surgeries & Networking
Transition to Client Site
Career Management & Personal Value Statement
What we need from you:
A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand
An ambition to work with data - don’t let it intimidate you, learning some coding is crucial in today’s age
Geographical flexibility, as our consultants often work across the UK
Educated to degree level with minimum 120 new (or 300 old) UCAS points, A-level (or equivalent) Maths preferred

There are currently c.450 employees globally, with exciting plans to grow rapidly in the next 18 months. We are a truly international organisation with over 30 different languages spoken. The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses.
Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) in various locations to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments. Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting. Although based out of our office in Piccadilly Circus, London, our BAs might, from time to time, be required to be on client site up to 4 days a week, depending on project needs. Because of this, flexibility to travel is essential.

Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise large data sets from a variety of sources, mastering the use of Excel and SQL. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work alongside the digital team to support the day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers via eFlow, as well as utilising Tableau to visualise the results of various analyses and support the project team in presenting the data in the most effective way. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.

BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. BAs must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.

Monitor accuracy of liability and reinsurance data being maintained by
TPAs which ultimately drives the P/L for the business. This is done through
data reconciliations and the use of exception reporting

=
Work with our TPAs to ensure operational service is delivered accurately
and per SLA. This will involve resolving queries and working with our
TPAs to refine and build process improvements

=
Reporting of key risk metrics to management

=
Perform a number of data reconciliations, analysing results and seeing
issues through to completion

=
Continuous process improvement is key in this growth business and
supporting projects and technology change is a function of this role

We hire a diverse range of junior professionals and graduates from across the country, we pay you while we train you in the latest data and business skills and then place you into industry-leading companies in a variety of different sectors. Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.
Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:
Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.
You will also have access to the following soft skills workshops:
Presentation & interview skills and practice
Lunch and Learns – How to research your client before an interview?
Q&As with HQ Teams, Consultant on placements, Kubrick Alumni and Clients
Client Surgeries & Networking
Transition to Client Site
Career Management & Personal Value Statement
What we need from you:
A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand
An ambition to work with data - don’t let it intimidate you, learning some coding is crucial in today’s age
Geographical flexibility, as our consultants often work across the UK
Educated to degree level with minimum 120 new (or 300 old) UCAS points, A-level (or equivalent) Maths preferred

Monitor accuracy of liability and reinsurance data being maintained by
TPAs which ultimately drives the P/L for the business. This is done through

Work with our TPAs to ensure operational service is delivered accurately
and per SLA. This will involve resolving queries and working with our
TPAs to refine and build process improvements

=
Reporting of key risk metrics to management

=
Perform a number of data reconciliations, analysing results and seeing
issues through to completion

=
Continuous process improvement is key in this growth business and

We hire a diverse range of junior professionals and graduates from across the country, we pay you while we train you in the latest data and business skills and then place you into industry-leading companies in a variety of different sectors. Through our training we will develop you into a highly skilled data consultant who can go onto becoming a leading expert in your field.
As Data Science soars in growth and popularity and the amount of data we produce increases daily, organisations are realising the true impact, value and risk of data. This has resulted in the emergence of a new highly important role, the role of the Data Management Analyst.
To satisfy demands of greater scrutiny and regulations, businesses and institutions are now expected to ensure consistent quality, integrity and usability of their data and having a sound data plan and data governance strategy is not only important but urgent. These analysts are therefore the front line in navigating this new world.
We hire excellent people, who often don’t have any prior data experience, teach them all they need to know and prepare them to help our clients realise their business potential, navigate risks and focus on careful governance and management of their digital information. Our clients range from telecommunications to fashion retail and financial services, giving our consultants the opportunity to work in various thriving industries.
But what does it mean to be a Data Management Analyst?
Kubrick Group is a data technologies consultancy at the forefront of what we call the ‘data governance movement’ and our Data Management analysts are highly sought after. Through our training we equip them with the ability to understand what happens to data in an organisation (i.e. data warehousing and quality management, architecture and security) from a technical, commercial and regulatory perspective. That means our analysts understand the lifecycle of information as it flows through the business, can access the data bases to make sense of the information and check its quality (using SQL etc.), and then present back to the business (using Tableau for example) to influence a company’s decision making on their data management and governance processes. Our consultants are often the commercial voice in an organisations’ data team and play a crucial role as ‘translator’ between the data team and the organisations’ business function allowing both to understand each other and work well together.
Has this caught your interest? – Keep reading and find out how we equip you for the job.
Your first 14-16 weeks at Kubrick Group are set aside for paid training in the skills you need to succeed in your career as a Data Management Analyst. You will work with experienced data governance practitioners and highly skilled technical trainers to:
Understand the commercial landscape and the regulatory drivers which are influencing management and governance of information now and in the future
Practice stakeholder management skills and adapting to an agile environment
Learn data modelling and the latest technology skills a Data Management Consultant needs such as Python, SQL, Collibra and Tableau
Refine your skills working on real life projects to prepare you for being a consultant on client site.
You will also have access to the following soft skills workshops:
Presentation & interview skills and practice
Lunch and Learns – How to research your client before an interview?
Q&As with HQ Teams, Consultant on placements, Kubrick Alumni and Clients
Client Surgeries & Networking
Transition to Client Site
Career Management & Personal Value Statement
What we need from you:
A desire to work with multiple stakeholders and facilitating effective communication between them
A love for problem solving, making sense of something complex and communicating it to others in a way that is easy to understand
An ambition to work with data - don’t let it intimidate you, learning some coding is crucial in today’s age

The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses.
Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) in various locations to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments. Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting. Although based out of our office in Piccadilly Circus, London, our BAs might, from time to time, be required to be on client site up to 4 days a week, depending on project needs. Because of this, flexibility to travel is essential.

Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise large data sets from a variety of sources, mastering the use of Excel and SQL. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work alongside the digital team to support the day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers via eFlow, as well as utilising Tableau to visualise the results of various analyses and support the project team in presenting the data in the most effective way. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.

BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. BAs must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet Syndrome are two rare and severe early-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes. CBD is approved in the US as Epidiolex. This is in addition to our deep pipeline of clinical stage cannabinoid candidates under development for both orphan and non-orphan indications with a particular focus on neurological conditions.

In the UK, we have close to 550 employees from a diverse range of backgrounds and disciplines based on four sites in Cambridge, Kent, London and Andover, along with employees working in the field.
