## Project Intro
The objective of this project is to further understand what it takes to be a financial analyst in London. This exercise will serve as a gateway to those seeking to become analyst themselves as well as create an entry point adapting a machine learning model in predicting what role may be expected in relation to the different variables.

## Project Description
As we move closer to the full cycle of graduates moving into the work force, the question has been posed is what does it take/what is it like to be a financial analyst? Some questions we plan on answering include:

- What kind of salary should be expected?
- What positions are the most popular?
- Types of companies Hiring?
- What industries are the most popular?
- Similarities between different roles?
- Other questions we might want answered as we explore the data some more?

    ### things to note:

* The data was gathered from Glassdoor job postings on 6/7/2020 via web scraper with the use of the Selenium Python library. As such, COVID-19  has remained a constant factor in our lives and should be taken into consideration.
* -1 represents data that wasn't specified in the job posting
* The sample size for this data set was 1,000 entries.

## Key findings
Some of the most common words mentioned in the analysis include: 'Problem Solving','Bachelor Degree','team' and 'attention to detail'
